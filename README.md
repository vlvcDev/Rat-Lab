# Rat Lab: A Java Program for Simulating Evolutionary Algorithms

## Introduction

Rat Lab is a Java program that simulates the evolution of a population of rats under selective pressure. The program uses a genetic algorithm to breed rats until they reach a desired average weight. The program also implements mutation and culling mechanisms to introduce variation and eliminate undesirable traits.

## Features

- The program allows the user to specify the initial population size, the initial weight range, the target weight, and the mutation rate.
- The program outputs the current generation number, the average weight, the best weight, and the worst weight of the population at each iteration.
- The program stops when the target weight is achieved or when the maximum number of generations is reached.
- The program displays a graphical representation of the population using Java Swing.

## How to Run

- To run the program, you need to have Java installed on your computer.
- Download or clone the Rat Lab repository from GitHub.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
- Compile the program by typing `javac RatLab.java` and press enter.
- Run the program by typing `java RatLab` and press enter.
- Follow the instructions on the console to enter the parameters for the simulation.
- Enjoy watching your rats evolve!
